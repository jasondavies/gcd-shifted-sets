# Logarithmic parameters for Gaussian detection

The temperature and dual radius can both be chosen proportional to `log Q + 1`.
This makes the spatial and spectral tail exponents identical. A power estimate
then absorbs the Gaussian normalizer uniformly over separated lattices of
covolume at most `Q`.

`Q` depends only on the dimension, before choosing the ambient space, lattice,
